This is a tool which allows users to build quantitative models which incorporate uncertainty.  The functionality is similar to a simplified version of the website [guesstimate](https://www.getguesstimate.com/), except as a python package.

This tool allows users to create distributions which correspond to their uncertainty about a parameter.  These parameters can be combined with arithmetic operations.  Monte-Carlo sampling is then used to approximate the uncertainty distributions of the resulting parameters.

For sample of the usage, see the [included example](examples/Corporate%20Campaigns.ipynb).
