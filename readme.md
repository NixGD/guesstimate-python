# Guesstimate-Python

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/guesstimate-python/badge/?version=latest)](https://guesstimate-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

## Purpose

This is a tool which allows users to build quantitative models which incorporate uncertainty.  The functionality is similar to a simplified version of the website [guesstimate](https://www.getguesstimate.com/), except as a python package.

This tool allows users to create distributions which correspond to their uncertainty about a parameter.  These parameters can be combined with arithmetic operations.  Monte-Carlo sampling is then used to approximate the uncertainty distributions of the resulting parameters.

## Instructions

For an example of the usage, see the [included example](examples/Corporate%20Campaigns.ipynb). Documentation can be found at [readthedocs](https://guesstimate-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
